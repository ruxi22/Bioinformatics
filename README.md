# FASTA Pattern Analysis Project

This project contains two small applications that work with DNA/RNA FASTA files.

## Exercise 1 — Pattern Repetition Detector
Download a sequence from NCBI and detect repeated patterns of sizes **3 to 6 bases**.

A valid repetition:
- must appear **consecutively** (one after another)
- must have at least **3 repetitions**


The script reports all such repeated motifs in the sequence.

## Exercise 2 — Influenza Strain Analyzer
Upload **10 (or more)** FASTA files containing different influenza strains.

The application:
- lets you choose FASTA files through a simple GUI  
- counts k-mers (patterns of length *k*)  
- extracts the **top 20 most frequent patterns** for each file  
- displays **all charts together** in one window for easy comparison

## Description
These tools help explore repeated motifs in DNA/RNA and compare influenza strain pattern frequencies.
