#  Viral Genome Sampling and Reconstruction

## Overview
This project simulates a simplified viral genome sequencing and reconstruction workflow.  
It allows the user to upload 10 viral genome FASTA files, generate random read samples, measure assembly times, calculate GC content, and analyze the relationship between nucleotide composition and computational performance.

This lab demonstrates the relationship between **biological sequence properties** and **computational analysis efficiency**.

## Objectives
1. **Obtain viral genomes** (1000–3000 nucleotides) from NCBI or similar databases.  
2. **Generate 2000 random samples** (100–150 bases each) for each genome.  
3. **Rebuild the genome** from these fragments.  
4. **Measure the assembly time** for each genome (in milliseconds).  
5. **Compute the GC-content (%)** for each genome.  
6. **Visualize** the relationship between GC% and assembly time with a scatter plot.  
7. **Generate a text report** summarizing and interpreting the results.
