# DNA Analysis & Gel Electrophoresis Simulation Project  
### Exercise 1 + Exercise 2 (Tkinter GUI Applications)


## Overview  
This project contains **two graphical (Tkinter) Python applications**, each performing  
a different type of **DNA gel electrophoresis simulation**.

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate:

- DNA sampling  
- Restriction enzyme digestion  
- Fragment length analysis  
- Agarose gel electrophoresis (in silico)  
- Biological data retrieval from NCBI  
- GUI programming using Tkinter  
- Visualization using Matplotlib  

Each exercise is implemented as a standalone `.py` program with a clean GUI.

### ✔ Generates or loads a DNA sequence (1000–3000 nt)  
Users may:
- Let the program create a random DNA sequence  
**OR**
- Paste a real FASTA sequence (e.g., from NCBI)

### ✔ Extracts 10 random DNA fragments  
Each fragment:
- Has a size between 100–3000 bp  
- Is stored in a table  
- Is used for gel simulation  

### ✔ Simulates agarose gel electrophoresis  
Migration is based on fragment size:
